Solarized Terminal w/Monaco 13pt

Solarized Dark - Monaco 13.terminal is my customized version of the OS X solarized terminal files by Tomislav Filipčić. The only change is that the font size has been set to 13pt from 11pt because I have a huge monitor and don't want to squint when I work in the terminal.
